  Implements Generic Governance, applicable for both proxy and main contract, and possibly others.
  Notes:
   The use of the same function names by both the Proxy and a delegated implementation
   is not possible since calling the implementation functions is done via the default function
   of the Proxy. For this reason, for example, the implementation of MainContract (MainGovernance)
   exposes mainIsGovernor, which calls the internal _isGovernor method.
